# Introduction to Android Development

![](android101.jpg)

This is where you can find all the labs for **Android 101**.

We will be covering and introduction to Android using a simple Case Study called ***Donation***

The labs will begin with a simple Android app and progress on to a fully fledged App with Custom Adapters and built-in persistence.

If you're looking for a bit more than an introduction, you should have a look at my [Mobile Application Development](https://www.gitbook.com/book/ddrohan/mobile-app-dev-labs/details) Labs.
