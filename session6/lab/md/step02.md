# Adding REST Support

The main purpose of this version of Donation is to connect to a Web Service ([our sister site](http://donationweb-4-0.herokuapp.com)) and be able to retrieve, insert and delete Donations.

To make things a bit easier I've devloped a simple API to make the HTTP calls and convert the responses from JSON into objects our Android App can use.

So go ahead and download the package here.
